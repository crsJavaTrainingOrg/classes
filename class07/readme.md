# Lottery 5

Create a Lottery 5 application where:
1. User can specify 5 numbers he thinks will be the winning number (numbers can be hardcoded into source files)
2. Application generates 5 different random number between 1<=number<=90
3. Print the winning numbers and count user's number which won.
	
# Shape application
Create an application which has 3 shapes:
* Triangle (has 3 properties a,b,c (double) the length of the sides of the triangle)
* Rectangle (has 2 properties a,b (double) the length of different sides)
* Circle (has 1 property r (double) the length of the radius)
	
Create the following methods for each shape:
* area which returns the area of the shape; (returns double)
* shapeFactory(int angleCount) Returns a shape which has as many angels as angleCount property (0: circle, 3: triangle, 4: rectangle). Return an error in case the paramter is not 0 or 3 or 4.
		
# Array
Given an array (int) with size: 10. (Use array not ArrayList!)

1. Create a cycle and generate a new random number in every cycle step (0<= number < 1000)
2. In case number !=0 add a new int to the array (eg add 1 to the array)
3. In case number is 0 exit the cycle
4. Print the size of the array.

Eg: in case the generated random number in the cycle is 0 in the 500'th cycle step then the application should create an array which contains 500 1-s and print 500.
